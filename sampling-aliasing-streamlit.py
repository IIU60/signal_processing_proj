This application demonstrates the effects of sampling rates on signal reconstruction 
and the phenomenon of aliasing. Adjust the parameters in the sidebar to see how they impact signal sampling and reconstruction.

### How to Use This App
1. **Set Signal Parameters** in the sidebar to define your signal composition
2. **Adjust Sampling Rates** to see how different sampling frequencies affect the signal
3. **Explore each tab** to understand different aspects of sampling theory
4. **Observe the effects of aliasing** when sampling below the Nyquist rate

### What You'll Learn
- How sampling rate affects signal representation
- What happens when signals are undersampled (aliasing)
- How the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem works in practice
- The relationship between time and frequency domains in digital signal processing

    The time domain graphs show how the signal varies over time. Each graph shows different aspects of sampling:
    
    - **Top Graph**: The original continuous signal that we want to sample
    - **Middle Graph**: Sampling with an adequate rate (above Nyquist frequency)
    - **Bottom Graph**: Sampling with a rate that causes aliasing (below Nyquist frequency)
    
    **Look for**: How sampling points (dots) capture the signal's shape. With adequate sampling,
    the points follow the curve closely. With undersampling, the points miss important variations in the signal.

    ### Signal Reconstruction Explanation
    
    The **Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem** states that a continuous bandlimited signal can be perfectly 
    reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate is greater than twice the highest frequency in the signal.
    
    - In the **top graph**, we sample at a rate well above the Nyquist rate ({} Hz), allowing for accurate reconstruction.
    - In the **bottom graph**, we sample below the Nyquist rate ({} Hz), causing aliasing and preventing accurate reconstruction.
    
    The reconstruction is performed using **sinc interpolation**, which is the theoretically perfect 
    reconstruction method for bandlimited signals sampled above the Nyquist rate.
    
    **Practical implications**: In real-world applications like audio recording, images, or sensor data, 
    sampling below the Nyquist rate results in information loss that cannot be recovered. This is why, for example, 
    CD-quality audio samples at 44.1 kHz - to capture frequencies up to about 20 kHz (the upper limit of human hearing).

    - **Sampling**: The process of converting a continuous signal into a discrete sequence of values at regular time intervals.

    - **Nyquist Rate**: To accurately represent a signal, you must sample at least twice as fast as the highest frequency component in the signal. This is a fundamental principle in digital signal processing.

    - **Aliasing**: When sampling below the Nyquist rate, high-frequency components appear as lower frequencies in the sampled signal. This creates distortion that cannot be removed once the signal is sampled.

    - **Signal Reconstruction**: The process of recreating a continuous signal from its samples, typically using interpolation methods like sinc interpolation.

    Try these experiments to better understand sampling and aliasing:

    1. **Find the Sweet Spot**: Gradually decrease the adequate sampling rate until you start to see reconstruction errors. This is where you're approaching the Nyquist limit.

    2. **Aliasing Patterns**: Set the secondary frequency much higher than the primary and use a very low sampling rate. Watch how the aliasing creates entirely new patterns.

    3. **Single Frequency**: Set the secondary amplitude to 0 to work with just one frequency. This simplifies the visualization and makes it easier to understand the basic principles.

    4. **Close to Nyquist**: Set sampling just barely above and just barely below the Nyquist rate to see the dramatic difference that this critical threshold makes.

Understanding sampling and aliasing is crucial in many fields:

- **Audio Engineering**: CD audio uses a 44.1 kHz sampling rate to capture frequencies up to 22.05 kHz (beyond human hearing range).

- **Image Processing**: Digital cameras must sample with enough pixels to capture the spatial frequencies in a scene.

- **Medical Imaging**: MRI and ultrasound technologies rely on proper sampling to create accurate diagnostic images.

- **Communications**: Wireless signals must be sampled appropriately to avoid information loss.

- **Scientific Measurement**: Data acquisition systems for scientific experiments must sample fast enough to capture all relevant signal components.
