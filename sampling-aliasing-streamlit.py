### How to Use This App
1. **Set Signal Parameters** in the sidebar to define your signal composition
2. **Adjust Sampling Rates** to see how different sampling frequencies affect the signal in the frequency domain and after reconstruction.
3. **Explore each tab** to understand different aspects of sampling theory and observe the effects of aliasing when sampling below the Nyquist rate

**Recommended Usage**: Start with the Time Domain tab to understand the basic signal and sampling concepts.
Then explore the Frequency Domain tab to see how different sampling rates affect the frequency spectrum.
Finally, check the Signal Reconstruction tab to understand the practical implications of your sampling choices.
Adjust the parameters gradually to build intuition for how sampling works.

    ### What You're Seeing

    The time domain graphs show how the signal varies over time. Each graph shows different aspects of sampling:

    - **Top Graph**: The original continuous signal that we want to sample
    - **Middle Graph**: Sampling with an adequate rate (above Nyquist frequency)
    - **Bottom Graph**: Sampling with a rate that causes aliasing (below Nyquist frequency)

    Note that with adequate sampling, the sampling points follow the curve closely. With undersampling, the points miss important variations in the signal.

    ### Signal Reconstruction Explanation

    The **Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem** states that a continuous bandlimited signal can be perfectly
    reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate is greater than twice the highest frequency in the signal.

    - In the **top graph**, we sample at a rate well above the Nyquist rate ({} Hz), allowing for accurate reconstruction.
    - In the **bottom graph**, we sample below the Nyquist rate ({} Hz), causing aliasing and preventing accurate reconstruction.

    The reconstruction is performed using **sinc interpolation**, which is the theoretically perfect
    reconstruction method for bandlimited signals sampled above the Nyquist rate.

    - **Sampling**: The process of converting a continuous signal into a discrete sequence of values at regular time intervals.

    - **Nyquist Rate**: To accurately represent a signal, you must sample at least twice as fast as the highest frequency component in the signal.

    - **Aliasing**: When sampling below the Nyquist rate, high-frequency components appear as lower frequencies in the sampled signal. This creates distortion that cannot be removed once the signal is sampled.

    - **Signal Reconstruction**: The process of recreating a continuous signal from its samples, typically using interpolation methods like sinc interpolation.

    1. **Find the Sweet Spot**: Gradually decrease the adequate sampling rate until you start to see reconstruction errors. This is where you're approaching the Nyquist limit.

    2. **Aliasing Patterns**: Set the primary frequency much higher than the secondary and use a very low aliasing sampling rate. Watch how the aliasing creates entirely new patterns.

    3. **Single Frequency**: Set the secondary amplitude to 0 to work with just one frequency. This simplifies the visualization and makes it easier to understand the basic principles.

    4. **Close to Nyquist**: Set sampling just barely above and just barely below the Nyquist rate to see the dramatic difference that this critical threshold makes in the quality of reconstruction.
